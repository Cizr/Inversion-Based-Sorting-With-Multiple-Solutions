# Inversion-Based-Sorting-With-Multiple-Solutions
Implementing sorting algorithms using inversion operations, aiming to minimize the number of inversions required for sorting any given array using search methods, including depth-first, breadth-first, random, and A* with custom heuristics, are employed to efficiently solve the inversion-based sorting problem
